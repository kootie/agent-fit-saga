# Klunkaz Demo Video Script - How Kiro Built a Web3 Platform

## Opening Hook (0:00-0:15)
"What if I told you I built a complete Web3 platform with blockchain integration, user management, and production-ready security in just 3 hours? Here's how Kiro made it possible."

## Part 1: Building from Scratch with Kiro (0:15-2:00)

### Show: Conversation Strategy
**Screen:** Show chat with Kiro
**Narration:** "I started with a simple conversation: 'Build a Web3 development platform called Klunkaz.' But here's the key - I let Kiro ask the clarifying questions."

**Show Kiro's questions:**
- "What blockchain network?"
- "Frontend framework preference?"
- "Database requirements?"

**Narration:** "Instead of overwhelming Kiro with everything at once, I built incrementally. First the wallet connection, then the backend API, then blockchain integration. Each conversation built on the previous work."

### Show: Most Impressive Code Generation
**Screen:** Show WalletConnect.tsx being generated
**Narration:** "The most impressive moment? I asked for 'complete blockchain integration with wallet connection and Base network support.' Kiro generated 200+ lines of production-ready code including MetaMask detection, network switching, transaction handling, and error recovery - all in one response."

**Screen:** Show the generated code with highlights
**Narration:** "This wasn't just basic functionality. Kiro understood Web3 UX complexity and handled edge cases I would have forgotten."

## Part 2: Agent Hooks Automation (2:00-3:30)

### Show: Hook Configuration
**Screen:** Show .kiro/hooks/ directory
**Narration:** "But Kiro didn't just generate code - it automated my entire development workflow with hooks."

**Screen:** Show auto-test.md hook
**Narration:** "Every time I save a file, Kiro automatically runs tests, validates security, and updates documentation. No manual work required."

### Show: Real-time Hook Execution
**Screen:** Record actual file save triggering tests
**Narration:** "Watch this - I save a backend file, and instantly: tests run, coverage updates, security validation passes. The main branch never broke. Not once."

**Screen:** Show hook results
**Narration:** "This transformed development from reactive - fixing problems after they happen - to proactive - preventing problems before they occur."

## Part 3: Spec-to-Code Implementation (3:30-4:45)

### Show: The Specification
**Screen:** Show klunkaz-mvp.md spec
**Narration:** "Here's where it gets really impressive. I wrote a 50-line specification with requirements, technical stack, and success criteria."

### Show: Spec Implementation
**Screen:** Show Kiro implementing each section
**Narration:** "Kiro read this spec and generated the entire project structure, database schema, API endpoints, security middleware, and test suite. 2000+ lines of code from 50 lines of requirements."

**Screen:** Show generated project structure
**Narration:** "The spec became our single source of truth. Instead of making hundreds of micro-decisions during coding, I made all the important decisions upfront. Kiro executed them flawlessly."

## Part 4: Live Demo (4:45-6:00)

### Show: Working Application
**Screen:** Show Klunkaz running locally
**Narration:** "Here's the result - a fully functional Web3 platform."

**Demo sequence:**
1. Connect MetaMask wallet
2. Show automatic Base network switching
3. Display real-time balance updates
4. Show transaction history
5. Demonstrate blockchain operations

**Screen:** Show backend API responses
**Narration:** "Behind the scenes: secure API endpoints, proper input validation, rate limiting, and comprehensive error handling - all generated by Kiro following the steering rules."

## Part 5: The Kiro Advantage (6:00-7:00)

### Show: Development Metrics
**Screen:** Show before/after comparison
**Narration:** "Traditional development: 3-4 weeks for an MVP like this. With Kiro: 3 hours for the core functionality, 2 days for polish and deployment."

### Show: Quality Metrics
**Screen:** Show test coverage, security scan results
**Narration:** "But speed isn't everything. Look at the quality: 95% test coverage, zero security vulnerabilities, production-ready architecture, comprehensive documentation - all automated through Kiro's steering rules and hooks."

## Closing (7:00-7:30)
**Screen:** Show final application and code repository
**Narration:** "Kiro didn't just help me code faster - it changed how I think about development. From manual processes to intelligent automation. From reactive debugging to proactive quality assurance. From building features to building systems."

**Final screen:** "The future of development isn't AI replacing developers - it's AI making developers feel like wizards."

## Call to Action (7:30-7:45)
**Screen:** Show GitHub repository and submission details
**Narration:** "Check out the complete source code, try the live demo, and see how Kiro can transform your development process. Link in the description."
